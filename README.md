# Solve-The-Rubix-Cube
I created this app to help people solve one of life's greatest mysteries, the Rubix cube. Its a simple and easy to follow step my step instuction manual to solve the cube. Its written in c# and and xaml and was created in Visual studios.The app has the local storage capacity to remember which page was last open when the app is closed so it can open up to that page again when next opened. It also plays a victorious sound when the last page is reached which should mean the user has completed the cube. It has a simple interface with no buttons just finger swiping.  I felt this was a good idea for an app as the main question i ask myself when creating an app is why will the user open it a second time. Well with this app unless more likely than not they will not remember how to do it the first time and therefore have to open and follow the app on multiple occasions before learning how to do it themselves. I created this app for one of my third year projects. Thanks for taking the time to look at my app.
